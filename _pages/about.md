ICFP Contest is an annual 72-hour programming contest organized under ICFP(International Conference on Functional Programming) since 1998.

As part of this year's contest, we would like to start building a memory for the contest. We are hoping to fill this page with facts and stories related to **history, philosophy, evolution and memories** of ICFP Contest. Please consider submitting any content you would like to share with us through a [PR to github](https://github.com/icfpcontest2022/icfpcontest2022.github.io).
